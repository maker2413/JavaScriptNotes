#+TITLE: JavaScript Notes

This repository is a playground for me to learn and try to take notes on things
I have learned while re learning JavaScript. I have learned JavaScript a couple
of times in the past and will probably gloss over most of the basics. For some
notes on the fundamentals of JavaScript you can look at my old guide on
JavaScript here: [[https://notes.ethancpost.com/javascript.html]].

I'm currently working on this course on Udemy to refresh my skills on
JavaScript: [[https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/]].
